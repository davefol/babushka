TERASHIMA2 data set 



Description: 480 Irregular test instances 

Artificially created data set with convex and non-convex polygons.

Procedure described by López-Camacho, 2012.

In each instance name, the number after letter C is the number of non-convex pieces.

Example: Instance TA001C5.txt has 5 non-convex pieces.

(Except in instances TU***C*C*.txt and TX***C*C*.txt, in which the number of 

non-convex pieces may vary).





For each instance we report:

- first line: the number N of pieces;

- second line: the width and height of the rectangular objects where pieces are placed.

- each of next N lines: number of vertices and coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xN yN.  

  Coordinates are counterclockwise.



Optimum is known and it is given.  

Optimum placing for <INSTANCE>.txt is in file Op<INSTANCE>.txt



For each file Op<INSTANCE>.txt we report:

- first line: the number of objects followed by how many pieces are in each object.

- second line: the width and height of the rectangular objects where pieces are placed.

- each of next N lines: number of vertices and coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xN yN

  where each piece is placed in the optimal solution.
